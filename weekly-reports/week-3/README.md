### What we have accomplished for the milestone this week:

- Set up the front end of our website using:
  - Webpack, web-pack-cli, and ts-loader to allow us to bundle all of our files together and avoid the hassle of creating many script and link tags.
  - livereload and connect-livereload to set up hot reloading for the front end code.
  - concurrently to run multiple commands in parallel.
- Set up a working connection to a locally hosted database
- Created all the routes that we will be using for our bingo game.
